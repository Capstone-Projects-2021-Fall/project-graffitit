            The <code>CreateHIT</code> operation creates a new Human Intelligence Task (HIT).
            The new HIT is made available for Workers to find and accept on the Amazon Mechanical
            Turk website. 
            
             
            <para>
             This operation allows you to specify a new HIT by passing in values for the properties
            of the HIT, such as its title, reward amount and number of assignments. When you pass
            these values to <code>CreateHIT</code>, a new HIT is created for you, with a new <code>HITTypeID</code>.
            The HITTypeID can be used to create additional HITs in the future without needing
            to specify common parameters such as the title, description and reward amount each
            time.
            </para>
             
            <para>
             An alternative way to create HITs is to first generate a HITTypeID using the <code>CreateHITType</code>
            operation and then call the <code>CreateHITWithHITType</code> operation. This is the
            recommended best practice for Requesters who are creating large numbers of HITs. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            CreateHIT also supports several ways to provide question data: by providing a value
            for the <code>Question</code> parameter that fully specifies the contents of the HIT,
            or by providing a <code>HitLayoutId</code> and associated <code>HitLayoutParameters</code>.

            The <code>ListAssignmentsForHIT</code> operation retrieves completed assignments
            for a HIT. You can use this operation to retrieve the results for a HIT. 
            
             
            <para>
             You can get assignments for a HIT at any time, even if the HIT is not yet Reviewable.
            If a HIT requested multiple assignments, and has received some results but has not
            yet become Reviewable, you can still retrieve the partial results with this operation.

             Use the AssignmentStatus parameter to control which set of assignments for a HIT

            rejected. You can set AssignmentStatus=Approved,Rejected to get assignments that have
            already been approved and rejected together in one result set.

            The QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker
            must have before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally

            <para>
             Setting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this QualificationRequirement
            from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include "Accept" (Worker cannot
            accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results), "PreviewAndAccept"
            (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their search results),
            and "DiscoverPreviewAndAccept" (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT in their
            search results). It's possible for you to create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements
            (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the
            Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements
            guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive
            are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all QualificationRequirements
            that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all requirements that are
            set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover, i.e. see the
            HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded
            should not be used in combination with the <code>RequiredToPreview</code> field.

            You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue

            The <code>SendBonus</code> operation issues a payment of money from your account
            to a Worker. This payment happens separately from the reward you pay to the Worker
            when you approve the Worker's assignment. The SendBonus operation requires the Worker's
            ID and the assignment ID as parameters to initiate payment of the bonus. You must
            include a message that explains the reason for the bonus payment, as the Worker may
            not be expecting the payment. Amazon Mechanical Turk collects a fee for bonus payments,
            similar to the HIT listing fee. This operation fails if your account does not have
            enough funds to pay for both the bonus and the fees.

            test for a type, you must specify the Test and TestDurationInSeconds parameters. The

            The <code>CreateHIT</code> operation creates a new Human Intelligence Task (HIT).
            The new HIT is made available for Workers to find and accept on the Amazon Mechanical
            Turk website. 
            
             
            <para>
             This operation allows you to specify a new HIT by passing in values for the properties
            of the HIT, such as its title, reward amount and number of assignments. When you pass
            these values to <code>CreateHIT</code>, a new HIT is created for you, with a new <code>HITTypeID</code>.
            The HITTypeID can be used to create additional HITs in the future without needing
            to specify common parameters such as the title, description and reward amount each
            time.
            </para>
             
            <para>
             An alternative way to create HITs is to first generate a HITTypeID using the <code>CreateHITType</code>
            operation and then call the <code>CreateHITWithHITType</code> operation. This is the
            recommended best practice for Requesters who are creating large numbers of HITs. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            CreateHIT also supports several ways to provide question data: by providing a value
            for the <code>Question</code> parameter that fully specifies the contents of the HIT,
            or by providing a <code>HitLayoutId</code> and associated <code>HitLayoutParameters</code>.
            
            </para>
             <note>

            The <code>CreateHIT</code> operation creates a new Human Intelligence Task (HIT).
            The new HIT is made available for Workers to find and accept on the Amazon Mechanical

             This operation allows you to specify a new HIT by passing in values for the properties
            of the HIT, such as its title, reward amount and number of assignments. When you pass
            these values to <code>CreateHIT</code>, a new HIT is created for you, with a new <code>HITTypeID</code>.
            The HITTypeID can be used to create additional HITs in the future without needing
            to specify common parameters such as the title, description and reward amount each
            time.

             An alternative way to create HITs is to first generate a HITTypeID using the <code>CreateHITType</code>

            recommended best practice for Requesters who are creating large numbers of HITs.
