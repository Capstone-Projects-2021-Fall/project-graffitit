## Project Overview

GraffitIT is a content sharing mobile application that stores photos, videos, and sounds at particular locations using tools such as the Google Maps API, SQL, and AWS S3. GraffitIT will capture visual media or audio from the user’s phone’s built-in camera and use Unity 3D as its primary framework, which will allow for AR capabilities and compatibility with both Android and Apple mobile devices. 

GraffitIT encourages an interactive experience while traveling to new locations. Since the media is only displayed when a user is within the same location that it was uploaded to, this leads to the experience of actively discovering content rather than simply browsing through content.
